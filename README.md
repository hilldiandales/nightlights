# Super Typhoon Yolanda: A Case Study in Remote Sensing-Based Disaster Response

This is the accompanying notebook for our submission to the [Pale Blue Dot Visualization Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/256/pale-blue-dot/page/802/). For more context about this notebook, make sure to visit our [project website](https://hilldiandales.github.io/nightlights/) where we display our visualizations, add more scientific context, and outline our methods.

## Overview

Every year, the Philippines loses lives and billions of dollars in economic damage to typhoons—and climate change is only making these disasters worse. In fact, the Philippines is among the few countries that are most at risk from the climate crisis. 

Filipino communities must therefore use innovative strategies to respond to disasters. Here we demonstrate one such strategy. Using satellite imagery from [NASA's Black Marble](https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/), we created interactive visualizations that can help in assessing damage or designing early-warning systems. To demonstrate this, we focus on 2013's Super Typhoon Yolanda—then the most destructive typhoon recorded in world history.

The data analysis in this project was primarily done in Python. Follow along the visualizing_yolanda.ipynb notebook to see how we conducted our analysis and visualization.
